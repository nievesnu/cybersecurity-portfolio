## Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity

### What is Cybersecurity?

> An ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations, and governments from digital attacks.

- How can hackers access your personal data? Through Medical records, Educational records & Employment and financial records.

### What do hackers want?

**Example (Phishing Attack):**  
A phishing scam targeted users of an online bank. Victims received an email that looked like a real notification warning of "suspicious activity" and asked them to click a link to verify their identity.  
The link led to a **fake login page**. When users entered their credentials, attackers stole the data and accessed their accounts.

### Identity Theft (is not a joke, Jim):
- Used to incur high medical bills (especially in systems without universal healthcare).
- Used to steal money or take out loans under another person’s name.

### Who else wants my data?
- **ISPs (Internet Service Providers):** Track your online activity and may sell it to advertisers.
- **Advertisers:** Use online habits and preferences for targeted ads.
- **Search engines & social media:** Collect gender, location, phone number, ideologies, etc.
- **Websites:** Use cookies to track and sell user data trails.

### Types of Organizational Data

- **Traditional:** Transactional data, intellectual property, financial data  
- **IoT:** Devices connected to the internet that collect and share data  

### The Security Cube (3D Framework)

#### CIA Triad – Core Principles of Cybersecurity:

- **Confidentiality:** Encryption, identity proofing, two-factor authentication  
- **Integrity:** Use of hash functions or checksums  
- **Availability:** Hardware maintenance, updates, backups  

#### Data States:

- **Data in process:** Actively being used (e.g., updating a database)  
- **Data at rest:** Stored on disk or memory  
- **Data in transit:** Moving between systems or networks  

### Protection Measures:

- **People:** Awareness, training, education  
- **Technology:** Firewalls, antivirus, secure hardware  
- **Policies and Procedures:** Rules and frameworks to govern access and response

### Data Security Breaches – Examples

- **Persirai Botnet:** Exploited IoT cameras via open ports for DDoS attacks  
- **Equifax Breach:** US credit reporting agency compromised due to web exploit  

### Consequences of Security Breaches

- **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust, compensation, slow recovery  
- **Vandalism:** Inserting false info (e.g., fake phone number on website)  
- **Theft:** Personal data used for fraud or identity theft  
- **Loss of Revenue:** Direct financial impact and business disruption  
- **Damaged Intellectual Property:** Leaked trade secrets hurt competitiveness

**Practical Case 1**: 
- Data: Massive data breach in an hotel chain the hackers couldn´t access account or financial info.
- Vulnerability: hackers gained access via customer database by using employees login details
- Result: The hackers stole the personal information of over three million hotel guests. This included their names, email addresses and phone numbers.
**Practical Case 2**: 
- Data: bad management of clients information - can be used for phising malware and fraud
- Vulnerability: leaving it at the public site - bad security practice (control your access via 2fa or smt!)
- Result: Hackers are targeting the increasing numbers of organizations who are migrating to the cloud or using cloud-based services and resources. In this scenario, hackers were able to take advantage of an organization’s poor security practices. Unsecured cloud databases left exposed on the Internet present a huge vulnerability and one that attackers will seek to exploit to gain easy access to valuable organizational data.  

In both cases, the organizations need to invest in improved security practices.

This might include:

- investing in cybersecurity training for all staff so that they are aware of and able to spot a cyber attack
- enforcing two factor authentication for employees accessing files and applications that contain sensitive data
- maintaining log files and ongoing monitoring to identify anomalous behavior that might indicate a data breach
- storing the passwords of customers using a combination of salting and robust hashing algorithms
- separating cloud-based resources from the public Internet into an isolated private network segment
- granting employee access to personal data and internal systems only via a secure VPN connection.

## Types of Attackers

- Script kiddies: amateurs
- White hat: breaks in prior permission to look for vulnerabilities to improve the security of a network or system
- Grey hat: similar to white but biased can published vulnerabilities they found or report to the owner
- Black hat: takes advantage of vulnerability for gain
- Organized hackers (Anonymus): have cyber criminals, hacktivists(awareness about issues) terrorist and state sponsored hackers (pigs, commits sabotage on behalf of their government, well funded)

**Internal Threats**: Employees => clumsy
**External Threats**: Outsiders => have to gain access

**Stuxnet malware** was designed not just to hijack targeted computers but to actually cause physical damage to equipment controlled by computers
Non-Trivial distribution, Sophistication, Modular coding, Unique Target(patience), Motive.
**The Purpose of Cyberwarfare** gain advantage over adversaries via compromised info via espionage = disruption & chaos.
