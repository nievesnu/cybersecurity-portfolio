- **Encryption:** converting information into a form in which unauthorized parties cannot read it
How? -> choose a folder > properties > advanced > Encrypt contents to secure data = EFS encription
- **BackupData:** at home, secondary location and in the cloud.
- **Delete Data Permanently:** It must be overwritten, to do so we have to use specific tools. Windows: SDelete, Linus Shred, MacOS X empty trash.
The only way to be certain that data or files are not recoverable is to physically destroy the hard drive or storage device.

**Data Ownership**
The Terms of Service are a legally binding contract that governs the rules of the relationship between you, the service provider and others who use the service.
Before agreeing to use an online service, read the privacy policy and terms of service to understand how your data will be used. Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to protect your account. Avoid sharing sensitive information unless necessary. Regularly update your software and review account activity. Be cautious of phishing attempts and only access services from secure networks.
To protect your data and safeguard your account, you should: always read the Terms of Service when registering for a new service and decide whether the service is worth waiving your rights to your data for
select your privacy settings rather than accepting the default, limit the group of people you share content with, review the service providerâ€™s security policy to understand what they are doing to protect your data,
change your passwords periodically, use a complex password and two factor authentication to secure your account.

**Two Factor Authentication** adds an extra layer of security for account logins.
- OAuth is an open standard protocol that allows you to use your credentials to access third-party applications without exposing your password.
- Social sharing rule: the less the best
- Dont get Spoofed
- Private browsing = less data of yourself trhough the internet bcs disabled cookies & traces of your roundabouts.

Password manager applications can protect passwords by saving them in a secure encrypted form. They enable random passwords to be generated and managed easily, averting the need for users to have the same password for multiple accounts, which presents a security risk.
