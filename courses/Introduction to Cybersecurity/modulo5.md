## Module 5: Will Your Future Be in Cybersecurity?

### Legal & Ethical Issues

* **Personal Legal Issues vs Corporate Legal Issues**
  If you are unsure whether an action or behavior might be illegal, **assume it is illegal and do not do it**. Always check with the organization's legal or HR department.
  International law and cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field. There are no traditional geographic boundaries in cyberspace.

* **Information Systems Security Association (ISSA)**
  An organization that has published **Codes of Ethics** to help guide employee actions and behaviors.
